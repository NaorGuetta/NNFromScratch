# NNFromScratch
NeuralNetworkFromScratch is an educational project demonstrating the creation of a neural network using Python. This repository contains a detailed Google Colab notebook that outlines the step-by-step process of building the neural network, accompanied by thorough explanations and a written assignment in PDF .

## Features

- Implementation of standard and ResNet layers
- Support for ReLU and Tanh activation functions
- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum optimizer
- Modular code structure for ease of understanding and extension
- Gradient checking to verify backpropagation implementation

## Documentation
For more detailed information, please refer to the following files in the docs directory:
- NeuralNetworkFromScratch.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the entire project in a single file.
- NeuralNetworkExplanation.pdf: A PDF document explaining the project in detail.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** ,remove docs if needed
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**
3. **Set up your training environment and parameters in traning.py**
4. **Run the training script:** python training.py
